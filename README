To create a new site, first update DNS with your shiny new domain name.
Once DNS has propagated:

- Copy skel to a new folder, and point webservice.cfg to the hostname and path of the new site.

- Add your code to the new folder, libs/ contains the application server services and pages/ contains content to be served (html/js/css for example, but can also be tornado templates).

- Then you need to update nginx and extend the certificates to enable the new domain name.
With letsencrypt, you can do that by running these commands as root:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d my.webapp.com -d another.website.com -d <new hostname>

- Restart webservice by killing the running process
- Then
	sudo -u www /opt/webservice/webservice
and you should be good to go.
